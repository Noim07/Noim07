<p>The first step to beating the first tutorial boss, which is named Goopy Le Grand. The way to beat this boss is to hold down your attack button always aiming for his face
and also to use the smoke dash ability as the boss is jumping around to avoid the boss then when he stops moving, crouch to avoid the punch attack and repeat until he starts his
second phase which is when you can collect three question marks by jumping on top of them and parrying them to collect energy which you can use to hit the boss with super attacks 
which deal extra damage. Then repeat the same process as the first phase and using all the super attacks you can until the boss enters his last phase, he turns into a gravestone and
you can easily evade his attacks as when he stops you can dodge it by using your smoke dash and to finish him off you can just shoot for his face on the grave. </p>
