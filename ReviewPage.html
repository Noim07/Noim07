<p>Rachel- 4 stars: This website really helped me too judge if I should play Cuphead or not but maybe it could have been more descriptive with somethings.<br>
Adam- 3 stars: I was thinking about getting Cuphead a while back and this convinced me to get it, but I keep on getting stuck and this guide isn't that good at teaching you about movement and parrying.<br>
Blake- 5 stars: I was stuck on a boss and couldn't get past it, this guide helped me with completing the game.<br></p>
